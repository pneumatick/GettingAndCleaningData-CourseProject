# Getting And Cleaning Data - Samsung Galaxy S Data Course Project
This is my peer-reviewed course project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" class for the "Data Science Specialization" course on Coursera.

## Key files
* [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) - The R script that performs all of the operations on the data, including creating and writing the separate data set of averages.
* [averageOfEachVariable.txt](data/averageOfEachVariable.txt) - The separate data set generated by run_analysis.R that consists of the average of each variable for each subject and activity from the original Samsung Galaxy S data.
* [CodeBook.md](docs/CodeBook.md) - The code book that defines each variable and explains what it represents.

## Explaination
Some aspects of this project were open-ended and left up to interpretation, so I will explain some of the choices that I made that others may not have made.

* When selecting variables that correspond to the means and standard deviations of variables, I only chose those that ended in either "mean()" or "std()" _explicitly_. I could have chosen to include any and all variables that had one or more instances of "mean" or "std", but that seemed to include irrelevant variables. The "features_info.txt" file seems to corroborate this, especially in the section starting on line 31.
